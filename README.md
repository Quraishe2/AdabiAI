## 🌍 Problem Statement

Classical poetry represents centuries of intellectual, spiritual, and cultural heritage. However, in the digital age, this heritage faces serious challenges:

- Fragmented and unreliable online sources
- Incorrect spellings and broken poetic structures
- Misattribution of couplets and ghazals
- Poor multilingual and cross-era search
- Lack of AI understanding of classical poetic forms

Existing platforms often treat poetry as plain text rather than a structured literary art.

The platform provides:
- Chronologically organized poet databases (earliest to latest)
- Verified biographical and literary metadata
